# cipher

Classical cryptography application

This is one of my first ever programming projects, made years ago (2013 according to file metadata). I do not have long-term plans of maintaining this software, though I may update it occasionally. I decided to publish the source code for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I wanted something to show off to people to demonstrate my programming skills. This is of course an old project, and I have grown significantly as a coder since writing it, but I am actually still proud of this project despite its somewhat messy (and not entirely finished) code. And secondly, I thought some others might be able to use it, perhaps as a simple toy, or as a tool to discover how some old ciphers worked.

The [user manual](https://github.com/dmjohnsson23/cipher/blob/master/Cipher%20User%20Manual.pdf) is a good place to get started using the software. It also contains some information about the various ciphers included, such as historical information and details about how the cipher works.

I currently only have a [Windows binary](https://github.com/dmjohnsson23/cipher/releases/tag/1.1) available, as that is the operating system I was using at that time. It relies on Python 3.4, PySide, and numpy. I do intend to eventually update the project to use PySide2 and newer versions of Python. After that I will try to create an appimage package for it to run on Linux. I have no intentions of supporting MacOS, though I expect it should work fine there too so long as you install the dependencies and run it from source.
